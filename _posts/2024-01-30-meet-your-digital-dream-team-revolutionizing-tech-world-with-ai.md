## Power of Collaborative AI
Hello, Micro Masters! Let's embark on an exciting journey into the realm of collaborative artificial intelligence (AI). Imagine your very own team of AI agents, each with unique skills, collaborating to create something extraordinary. With the recent advancements in AI, this is not just possible, but also incredibly empowering and fun!

### Introducing Crew AI: Your Virtual AI Team

Crew AI is a framework enabling you to build a team of cooperative AI agents, each playing their own role, to achieve a common goal. For instance, It's like having your own team but powered by AI agents instead of people! You can mix and match different AI models and tools from LangChain's extensive toolbox like browsing the internet, complex calculations etc... and even create your own tools.

### Getting Started with Crew AI

For demonstration purposes, let us consider two agents, one researcher(Scout), who searches the internet for latest advancements in tech and another content writer (Scribe), who geneates a 10 minute youtube video script based on the research done by the Scout.

![Crew-AI-Tutorial](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/micromastery/micromastery.github.io/main/assets/CrewAI-Tutorial-1/Crew-AI-Tutorial-1.png)
<sub><sup>*simplified diagram</sup></sub>
#### Prerequisites:

- Python 
- Basic Knowledge about LangChain ( If not, Get started [here](dshttps://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/get_starteda))

#### Installation:

- Run `pip install crewai` in your terminal.
- For using langchain tools, follow the instructions [here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/). More on this below.
- Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 (for Windows users)


#### Dive into the Code:

Check out this [GitHub link](https://github.com/micromastery/CrewAI-Tutorial) for a full example.

#### Building Your AI Agents:

```python
from langchain_community.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchRun
search_tool = DuckDuckGoSearchRun()

scout = Agent(
  role='Scout',
  goal='''1. Identify trending and popular topics in technology...
  3. Determine the relevance and potential interest of these topics...''',
  backstory='''You are Scout. Scout operates in a constantly changing environment...
  Scout's role is to search the internet for trending and relevant technology topics...''',
  verbose=True,
  allow_delegation=True,
  # llm=OpenAI(model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct", temperature=0.7),
  tools=[search_tool]
)
```

Each agent, like Scout, has a defined role, goal, and backstory. These elements guide the agent's actions and objectives.

#### Language Model and Tools:

Agents can utilize various language models, with GPT-4 as the default. For example, to use `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct` model,

```
# llm=OpenAI(model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct", temperature=0.7)
```

You can also integrate multiple tools like search, Wolfram Alpha, YouTube, Google Drive, and more, available in langchain. Here's the exciting part: You're not limited to just these tools. Crew AI enables you to code your own custom tools which is not in the scope of this blog post.


Remember to set your OpenAI API key if using OpenAI models.
```python
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "<OPENAI_API_KEY>"
```



#### Setting Up Tasks and Crew:

```python
task1 = Task(
  description='''Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the latest advancements in tech in 2024...
  Your final answer MUST be a full analysis report''',
  agent=scout
)

crew = Crew(
  agents=[scout, scribe],
  tasks=[task1, task2],
  verbose=2 # Adjust logging levels as needed
)
```

Define tasks with specific instructions and create a 'crew' with your agents and tasks. The crew operates sequentially, passing outputs from one agent to the next.

#### Launching Your AI Team:

```python
result = crew.kickoff()
print(result)
```

Start the CrewAgent Executor, and watch as your AI team works together to complete tasks and create outputs.
[Check out the detailed interaction among the agents here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/micromastery/CrewAI-Tutorial/main/SampleOutput.txt).

#### The Outcome:
