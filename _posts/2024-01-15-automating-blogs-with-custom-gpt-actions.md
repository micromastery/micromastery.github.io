## Introduction

Creating and maintaining a blog can be a time-consuming task, especially when it comes to writing and posting content regularly. Automation can play a key role in simplifying this process. In this tutorial, we will explore how to automate blog postings using custom GPT actions and a GitHub integrated Flask application. This setup allows you to efficiently generate and post content directly to your GitHub repository powered blog.

## Setting Up the GitHub Repository

Firstly, ensure you have a GitHub repository that uses a Jekyll theme, set up to render markdown files placed in a specific folder as blog posts. This can be any Jekyll-based theme, such as the popular Chirpy theme.

### Getting Your GitHub Client ID and Secret

For GitHub integration, you need to obtain your Client ID and Client Secret. These can be obtained by:

1. Log into your GitHub account.
2. Navigate to your repository settings.
3. Go to the 'Developer settings' section.
4. Click on 'OAuth Apps' and create a new OAuth application.
5. Fill in the required details, including the callback URL, and you will receive your Client ID and Secret.

## Flask Backend for GitHub Integration

Next, you'll need a backend service to handle GitHub OAuth and post content to your repository. Below is a Python Flask application that serves this purpose:

```python
# Flask code here
```

This code sets up a basic Flask application with endpoints for GitHub OAuth and posting markdown content to a GitHub repository.

### Deploying the Flask Application

You can deploy this Flask application using various services like Vercel or PythonAnywhere. Choose a service that best fits your needs and deploy the code.

## Integrating with Custom GPT Actions

After deploying your Flask application, the next step is integrating it with custom GPT actions. This involves setting up an OpenAPI schema and configuring authentication.

### OpenAPI Schema

Here's an example of an OpenAPI schema for the GitHub Integration API:

```json
# OpenAPI schema here
```

### Authentication Setup

For authentication, use the 'API Key' type. Set the header name as 'Authorization' and use the API key obtained from your Flask application's login endpoint.
